        Hi, I'm Ahmad Chalhoub. I hold a bachelor's degree in Robotics Engineering from Detroit Mercy, and am currently a perception engineer based in Michigan, leading perception development efforts for geofenced autonomous trucks at Mitsubishi Electric Automotive America (check out our work here: https://www.hubpilot.ai/)! My work focuses on designing and implementing a combination of deep learning and 3D computer vision algorithms to solve real-world logistics problems. I work on the full development pipeline, going from initial research, prototyping, planning for data collection and labeling, model training and evaluation, integrating models into the overall system using ROS, and testing and validating the solutions that I build.

    <div class="intro-text second-paragraph">
        In addition to the industry work that I do, I am also very passionate about the topic of causality and its intersection with robotics and AI. I am currently a master's student in computer science at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, where I am focusing on improving and doing research in my above topics of interest.
